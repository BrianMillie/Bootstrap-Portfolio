## Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Description

This project is to test use of bootstrap css stylings and improve on the previous project of a portfolio

I have added much more fuctionality including the required Media queries limited due to bootstrap styling, hoover effects on buttons, i even added links to my social media accounts

The nav bar moves around to required areas on the page and the hyperlinks also hoover

My skills section is spaced to show grid use before my projects

I have struggled to put an automated draft email on click of a button and have found no useful assistance from the web, classmates or tutors
